## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time I changed my work process, creating the mobile layout first and then creating the desktop layout. I know this webpage is very basic but it was good to try by myself the Mobile-First workflow.

### Continued development

Probably I'll try create webpages using Mobile-first workflow again in the next challenge because I think people are using their cellphones more to see websites, etc.
